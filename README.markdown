Usage
=====

Add `KSSelectionBorder.h`, `KSSelectionBorder.m`, `ESCursors.h`, and `ESCursors.m` to your project. Ideally, make this repo a submodule, which in turn includes ESCursors as a submodule. But hey, it's your codebase, do whatever you feel like.

In your code, instantiate `KSSelectionBorder`s as needed and ask them to draw. A variety of instance methods are also provided to figure out precisely where and how to draw, and the cursor for resize handles.
